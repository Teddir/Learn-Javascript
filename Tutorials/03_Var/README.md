## Var in Javascript
----------
- The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

- Basically, if you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

- var price1 = 100.2;  <br>
var price 2 = 200.8;     <br>
var  total_price = price2 - price1; <br>

- Output : 301 <br>

    We have declared 3 variables price 1, price 2 and total_price of the type Var.
