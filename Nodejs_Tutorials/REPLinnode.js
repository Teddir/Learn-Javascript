 //REPL is very useful in experimenting with nodejs codes and to debug javascript codes
// R- Read user's input and parses the input into js data structure
// E- Takes and evaluates the data structure
// P- Prints the result
// L- Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl+c
// To start REPEL , we type node in terminal
// REPL
// 1: js expression
// 2: use variables
// 3: Multiline code
// 4: use (_) to get the last result
// 5: we can use editor mode
// With the help of REPL (which is in node-js by which we are able to run js in terminal)
// use _(underscore) to fetch the last result that was computed .
// we can create editor mode can define functions in them
// press tab 2 times to get to know the things included in node
// write fs to know about the methods included  in node
