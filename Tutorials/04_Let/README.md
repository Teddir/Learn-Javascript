## Let in Javascript
----------
- ```Rules for Let```
   - Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
   - Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
   - Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

- Let and const provide **block scope** which means that : ```"Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block."```


## Code Snippet
----
let x = 5;
// Here x is 5

{ <br>
let x = 2;<br>
// Here x is 2<br>
}

Output : 5
