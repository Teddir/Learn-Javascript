//nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based 
//applications by automatically restarting the node application,when we save it
//when file changes in the directory are detected

//npm i nodemon -g

// now this is a gloabal module so we dont have to install it for every 
// file ..for that we have to put a flag -g (global)
console.log('HI')
console.log('YO')
console.log('YL') 

// no dependency can be seen in the package.json,because it is a global module
